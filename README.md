# T2MotionAimingWCalib

Sctipt features:

- Motion (gyro) aiming.

- Configurable motion aiming activation buttons.

- Adjustable motion sensitivity index (using R3 + DPAD-UP/DOWN).

- Toggle always on motion aiming (using R3 + DPAD-RIGHT).

- Toggle motion aiming (using R3 + DPAD-LEFT).

- Gyro calibration (using L3 + R3 + Home).

- Persistent configurations (per controller type DualShock 4/Pro Controller/Other).

- DualShock 4 touchpad mimicking on non DualShock 4 controllers (using Minus + Right Stick).

- Configurable deadzones.

To calibrate your controller put it on solid surface, press L3 + R3 + Home, wait for 3 secunds (or other amount of time depending on your delay/samples settings).

If calibration is stucked (controller's LEDs aren't back to normal), please restart the calibration/Titan Two.

Due to nature of motion aiming a controller could generate unwanted moves (recoil) on pressing trigger buttons or when rumble. Due to that I suggest using Switch Pro Controller over DualShock 4, as it lacks analog triggers and the rumble is much weaker compared to DualShock4.

I'm open for issue reports pull requests.
